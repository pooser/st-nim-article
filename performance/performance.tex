\section{Performance} \label{sec:perform}

The ST was installed just prior to the Fall 2014 \gx{} commissioning run in Hall-D.  It was not until the Spring 2015 commissioning run that enough statistics were obtained with an $\mathrm{LH_{2}}$ target to perform reliable calibrations.  With the aforementioned data set, the procedures to calibrate the detector and measure it's performance were developed. 

%Fig.~ illustrates the phenomenon in which the light output increases exponentially as the scintillaton source moves towards the downstream end.
