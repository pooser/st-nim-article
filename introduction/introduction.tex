\section{Introduction}

The \gx{} experiment, staged in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), primarily aims to study the rich spectrum of photo-produced mesons with unprecedented statistics.  The coherent bremsstrahlung technique is implemented to produce a linearly polarized photon beam incident on a liquid $\mathrm{H_{2}}$ target. A Start Counter detector was fabricated to properly identify the photon beam buckets and to provide accurate timing information.
