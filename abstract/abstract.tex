The design, fabrication, calibration, and performance of the \gx{} Start Counter detector is described.  The Start Counter can operate at photon intensities up to $\mathrm{10^{8}\gamma/s}$ in the coherent peak and provides a range of timing resolutions of $\mathrm{450-700\ ps\ (FWHM)}$ thus providing successful identification of 500~MHz photon beam buckets to within than 94\% accuracy. Furthermore, the Start Counter provides excellent solid angle coverage, $\sim 90 \%\ \mathrm{of}\ 4 \pi\ \mathrm{hermeticity}$, a high degree of segmentation for background rejection, and can be utilized in the level 1 trigger for the experiment.  It consists of a cylindrical array of 30 thin scintillators with pointed ends that bend towards the beam at the downstream end. Magnetic field insensitive silicon photomultiplier detectors were selected as the readout system.
