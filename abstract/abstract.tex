The design, fabrication, calibration, and performance of the \gx{} Start Counter detector is described.  The Start Counter detector was designed to operate at photon intensities of up to $\mathrm{10^{8}\gamma/s}$ in the coherent peak and provides a timing resolution of $\approx \mathrm{250\ ps}$ thus providing successful identification of the electron beam buckets to more than 99\% accuracy. Furthermore, the Start Counter detector provides excellent solid angle coverage, $\sim 90 \%\ \mathrm{of}\ 4 \pi\ \mathrm{hermeticity}$, a high degree of segmentation for background rejection, and is utilized in the level 1 trigger for the experiment.  It consists of a cylindrical array of 30 thin scintillators with pointed ends that bend towards the beam at the downstream end. Magnetic field insensitive silicon photomultiplier detectors were selected as the readout system.
